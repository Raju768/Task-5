          Kakinada (formerly called Kakinandiwada, Coringa, and Cocanada;
          listenâ“˜) is the sixth largest city of the Indian state of Andhra
          Pradesh and serves as the district headquarters of the Kakinada
          District.[6] It lies on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. J.N.T.U.
          College of Engineering Kakinada, established in 1946, is the oldest
          and popular Government college in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The
          First Polytechnic college of Andhra Pradesh, Andhra Polytechnic was
          established here in 1946. It was also the origin point of Buckingham
          Canal where goods used to be transported by boats during the British
          rule. It was once home for Asia's largest sea port (now near the
          village Coringa). Many people from the city migrated from this sea
          port to countries like Burma, Mauritius, Fiji and various southeast
          Asian countries to work there as workers where they were called as
          Coringas.[citation needed] Kakinada is also one of the fastest growing
          city in Andhra Pradesh, and also a twin city of Pithapuram. Kakinada
          is known for its sweet called Kaja which became a famous recipe in
          South India known as Kakinada Kaja. Apart from this, it is also known
          for food. The city is popular for "Subbayya Gari Hotel" known across
          the country for its authentic Vegetarian meals. The city is also home
          to a snack called Bajji which is famous throughout the state. Along
          with these it is mostly known for its town planning, one of the most
          greatly well planned towns in the entire country. The Indian Standard
          Time (IST) exactly passes through this city in the southern part of
          India. Hope Island, which lies just off the city's coast, naturally
          acts as a barrier and protects the city from cyclones and tsunami
          effects which also serves as a tourist spot. It used to have more than
          15 cinema theatres along a road (for which it has a dedicated road
          named after that as Cinema Road) and is known as Second Madras
          (because Madras [now Chennai], used to have many cinema theatres along
          a road). It also has a dedicated road for temples known as Temple
          street which justifies its status as the best-planned city. It is also
          known for its pleasant climate and recreating atmosphere for which, it
          is also known as Pensioner's Paradise indicating as a place to settle
          for mental peace and health. It is also a gateway for a region called
          Konaseema which is regarded as Second Kerala which is very famous for
          its scenic Coconut Trees and picturesque green farm fields surrounded
          by River Gouthami just like Kerala. It also has the second largest
          Mangrove forests in India near a village named Coringa which serves as
          a great tourist spot in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary. It also has one of
          the oldest and biggest Government Hospitals of the state known as
          Government General Hospital, Kakinada. Due to the love for Cinema and
          arts it had for years, the city is also home for many Telugu Cinema
          (Tollywood) film celebrities namely Suryakantham, Rao Gopal Rao,
          Relangi, P. B. Srinivas, C. S. Rao, Chitti Babu, P. Adinarayana Rao,
          Chaganti Koteswara Rao, Krishna Bhagawan, Goutham Raju, Ohmkar, Anchor
          Syamala, Singer Anjana Sowmya, Pavala Syamala. Culturally, the city
          has a popular dialect known as Godavari Dialect which is one of the
          most famous dialects of Andhra Pradesh. Politically, it is also a very
          important seat of power as there is a sentiment of forming the
          Government in Andhra Pradesh if won in this region. It is also close
          to many famous holy temples of the district. It is one of the three
          smart cities of Andhra Pradesh under Smart Cities Mission.[7] A second
          new port is being constructed by GMR Group which will become the
          biggest port in the state. A Petroleum Complex is constructed by the
          Indian government as the region is full of gas and petroleum
          resources. It is one of the most rapidly developing cities of the
          India.

          Hyderabad is the capital of the state of Telangana (separated from
          Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014). Between 1983 and 1989, N. T. Rama Rao
          served as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure, he
          spent large sums to erect several statues of people from the region's
          political and religious history. During his visit to New York, he saw
          the Statue of Liberty and was inspired by the efforts to restore it.
          He said "I wanted something like that great place to visit... That
          would have been my contribution to society."[1] Rama Rao chose to
          depict Gautama Buddha because "he was a humanitarian who told the
          whole truth to the people. It is our pride."[1] After a long search,
          he found a solid white granite rock near Raigiri, Bhuvanagiri (Yadadri
          Bhuvanagiri district) on a mountainside 46 km outside Hyderabad. In
          October 1985 NTR inaugurated work on structure. For over a year,
          hundreds of labourers helped the temple architect and builder
          S.M.Ganapathi Sthapati create the statue. After five years and the
          expenditure of US$3 million,[1] the statue stood at 58 feet (18 m) and
          weighed 350 tons, making it the world's tallest monolithic statue of
          the Buddha.[2] A concrete platform measuring 15 feet (4.6 m), now
          referred to as the "Rock of Gibraltar,"[3] was constructed in the
          middle of Hussain Sagar to aid in erecting the statue. The roads of
          the city were also widened for this purpose.[1] This statue is located
          at Lumbini Park in the Hussain Sagar Island can be reached by boat in
          15 minutes.[4] The statue is near to Lakdi-Ka-Pul, Khairatabad and
          Assembly Hyderabad metro stations.Then government of Andhra Pradesh
          led by N. T. Rama Rao was ousted in 1989. By the next year, the statue
          was ready for erection. ABC Limited, a local company, was given the
          responsibility of transferring the statue onto the concrete platform.
          Using a trailer vehicle, the statue was brought to the shore of
          Hussain Sagar. On 10 March 1990, company workers shifted the statue on
          top of a barge. After traveling only 100 yards (91 m), the statue
          tipped and fell into the lake.[1][5] The accident killed 10 people.[6]
          After a two-year salvage operation, the statue was pulled out of the
          lake.[2] On 1 December 1992, the statue was installed on the platform
          successfully. In 2006, the Dalai Lama consecrated the statue after
          performing a ritual.[7].

          The oldest inscription in current-day Bengaluru is the Hebbal-Kittayya
          inscription, which dates back to the Ganga dynasty in Karnataka and
          mentions the administration of Sripurusha. Carved in early Kannada
          script, it pays tribute to Kittayya, who was martyred defending his
          land in a battle during Sripurushaâ€™s reign.[2] The Gangas ruled
          Gangavadi from Kolar starting c. 350 and later shifted their capital
          to Talakadu.[3] The first mention of the name Bengaluru, albeit in the
          form 'Benguluru' is from an inscription in Begur dated to 9th century
          AD. Written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), it mentions 'Bengaluru
          Kadana' (battle of Bengaluru). The inscription stone found near Begur
          reveals, that the district was part of the Ganga Kingdom ruled from
          Gangavadi until 1024 AD and was known as 'Benga-val-oru', the City of
          Guards in old Kannada.[4] Edgar Thurston (Castes and Tribes of India
          Volume 5) states that the Kongu region was ruled by a series of twenty
          eight kings before being conquered by the Cholas of Tanjore, citing
          the earliest portion of the Kongu Chronicle - Kongu Desa Rajakkal (a
          manuscript in The Mackenzie Collection) which gives a series of short
          notices of the reigns of all the kings who ruled the country from the
          start of the Christian era till its conquest by the Cholas. These
          kings belonged to two distinct dynasties: the earlier line of the
          Solar race which had a succession of seven kings of the Ratti tribe,
          and the later line of the Ganga race, itself claimed to be a branch of
          the Solar race. The Hebbal-Kittayya inscription stone dated to 750 AD
          found in Hebbal, Bengaluru In 1024 AD, the Chola Empire captured the
          city. Today, little evidence can be seen of this period. A small
          village in south Bangalore and one in Anantapur district bear the
          Chola name but the residents are of native stock. The later Gangas
          often fought alongside the Chalukyas, Rastrakutas and the Hoysalas. In
          1117 AD, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas in the
          battle of Talakad which led to the Hoysalas regaining control of
          Talakad.
